    This project delves into digital image steganography, a vital component of secure communication in today's digital landscape. Steganography conceals sensitive information within seemingly innocuous cover media, offering a covert alternative to encryption. Focusing on the frequency domain approach, mainly using techniques like the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), this study explores embedding secret data within digital images. By manipulating the frequency components, imperceptible alterations are made to the digital images, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the hidden information. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of digital image steganography, discussing its methodologies and applications.
