\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:Problem Statement}
Developing a robust digital image steganography method that enhances the imperceptibility and capacity of hidden information within images. By leveraging the Fourier Transform, this technique will seek to embed data without compromising the image's visual integrity, ensuring that the embedded message remains undetectable to both visual and algorithmic detection methods while maintaining resistance to common image processing operations.
